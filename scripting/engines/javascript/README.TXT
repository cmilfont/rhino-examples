This is JSR-223 script engine for Rhino - Java implementation of JavaScript.
Rhino is available for download at http://www.mozilla.org/rhino.
We have built and tested with Rhino version 1.6 release 7. There is
a Rhino based JavaScript engine bundled in JDK 6 (http://jdk6.dev.java.net). 
The JDK 6 bundled version is based on Rhino 1.6 release 2.

Unlike JDK 6 bundled engine, all Rhino features (optimizer, E4X) are enabled in this version. 

Engine class names used in this code base are different from that 
in JDK 6 to avoid name clashing.
